	abstract = {The formation of the iron({III})-thiocyanate complex in sulphuric and perchloric acids has been studied spectrophotometrically. Under no circumstances has any evidence been found that more than one thiocyanate ion enters the complex, contrary to widely held beliefs that up to six ions may be involved. Hydroxyl, sulphate and hydrogen sulphate ions and water molecules complete the co-ordination sphere. Decomposition products have been isolated and identified. Three ranges of acid concentration are identified, each region characterised by the manner of variation of the molar absorptivity and formation constant with change in acid concentration, and an interpretation is offered. Decomposition of both reagent and complex render thiocyanate unsatisfactory as a reagent for the precise determination of iron.},

The measured relaxation rates are interpreted as a linear combination of the concentration of the different complexes. With this assumption, the following stepwide formation constants are given: log K1 = 2.53, log K2 = 1.35, log K3 = 1.31, log K4 = 1.33, log K5 = −0.32. The ratio of the stepwise equilibrium constants and the molar relaxation coefficients are interpreted by assuming octahedral-tetrahedral configuration equilibria in case of the bis, tris and tetrakis complexes.},

	abstract = {The calibration procedure of stopped-flow instruments based on the dead-time concept has been improved. It is proved theoretically and shown experimentally that the dead-time is not a simple instrumental parameter; it depends on the rate of the reaction. Two new parameters are introduced for improved calibration: the filling time of the observation cell and the theoretical starting time, which is the time elapsed between the mixer and the end of the observation cell. Various experiments are presented for the determination of these parameters. The proposed calibration procedure is based on the evaluation of all experimental curves simultaneously, taking the concentration constraints into account. The simultaneous evaluation is possible because the recently developed stopped-flow spectrophotometers give accurate measured absorbances. Therefore, the use of the pseudo-first-order approach is not necessary; measurements carried out under second-order conditions may also be evaluated without any simplification. The formation kinetics of the well-known {FeSCN}2+ complex has been reinvestigated in order to compare the results of the experiments carried out under pseudo-first-order and second-order conditions. The equilibrium and kinetic studies were carried out in an extended concentration and {pH} range. A slightly modified mechanism, involving the reaction between Fe2({OH})24+ and {SCN}−, and the appropriate rate constants are reported. The evaluation procedure developed can be extended to arbitrary reactions, and thus it increases the type of reactive chemical systems accessible for stopped-flow studies (e.g. accumulation of absorbing intermediates, autocatalytic reactions, etc.).},

	abstract = {Complexation of iron({III}) with thiocyanate ions has been calorimetrically and spectrophotometrically investigated in N,N-dimethylformamide ({DMF}) containing 0.4 mol/dm3 (C2H5)4NClO4 or 1 mol/dm3 {NH}4ClO4 as a constant ionic medium at 25°C. Calorimetric titration data were well explained in terms of the formation of [Fe({SCN})n](3-n)+ (n = 1–5), and their formation constants, reaction enthalpies and entropies were determined. Electronic spectra of individual iron({III}) thiocyanato complexes were also determined. The stepwise thermodynamic quantities changed monotonously, i.e. ΔG°1 {\textless} ΔG°2 {\textless} ΔG°3 {\textless} ΔG°4, {\textless} ΔG°5, ΔH°1 {\textgreater} ΔH°2 {\textgreater} ΔH°3 {\textgreater} ΔH°4 {\textgreater} ΔH°5, ΔS°1 {\textgreater} ΔS°2 {\textgreater} ΔS°3 {\textgreater} ΔS°4 {\textgreater} ΔS°5. This suggests that no extensive desolvation occurred at any step of complexation. On the basis of these thermodynamic quantities, it is postulated that the [Fe({SCN})n](3-n)+ (n = 1–5) complexes have a six-coordinate octahedral structure as well as the [Fe(dmf)6]3+ ion, the octahedral structure of which has been confirmed by the {EXAFS} (extended X-ray absorption fine structure) method.},

Experimental Raman spectra of the iron({III}) isothiocyanate with higher coordination number in the acidic aqueous solution have been analyzed. Molecular modeling of the iron({III}) monoisothiocyanate complex was accomplished by the density functional theory ({DFT}) method using B3LYP and {PBE}1PBE functionals. Theoretical vibrational spectra of the iron({III}) monoisothiocyanate were interpreted by means of the potential energy distributions ({PEDs}). The influence of different solvation models and position of {SO}42− ligand vs. {NCS}− ligand upon its geometry and vibrational frequencies have been evaluated. The effect of H2O/D2O isotopic substitution on the experimental and calculated Raman spectra of iron({III}) isothiocyanates has been examined. Procedures of Raman spectra subtraction have been applied for the extractions of weak and/or obscured Raman signals. As a result, the presence of bound {SO}42− ion and water molecules in the first coordination sphere in the acidic aqueous iron({III}) isothiocyanate solution was confirmed. The vibrational assignments for the investigated iron({III}) isothiocyanates were proposed here for the first time.},

However, for titrate concentrations in the range 0.0010–0.0020 mol dm−3, this factor is less than unity but progressively approaches unity as the titrant concentration nears 0.0020 mol dm−3. This phenomenon is explained in terms of a thermal bleaching effect and is demonstrated by the use of an inhibitor in these thermometric titrations. Al3+ and Mn2+ cause no measurable interference effect in the Fe3+/{SCN}− thermometric titration.

A thermometric titration with Ag+ (0.0007–0.0030 mol dm−3) as titrate and {SCN}− (0.1000 mol dm−3) as titrant reveals one end-point-the corresponding measured molar reaction heat is −86.65 ± 3.85 {kJ} mol−1 {andnAg}+/{nSCN}−is 0.97 ± 0.02. Al3+ causes no measurable interference effect in this titration.

The overall thermoanalytical data obtained for these two systems suggest that thiocyanate can be used as a reagent for the determination of Fe3+ and Ag+ in aqueous solution by thermometric titrimetry.},
