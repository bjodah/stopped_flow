	abstract = {The calibration procedure of stopped-flow instruments based on the dead-time concept has been improved. It is proved theoretically and shown experimentally that the dead-time is not a simple instrumental parameter; it depends on the rate of the reaction. Two new parameters are introduced for improved calibration: the filling time of the observation cell and the theoretical starting time, which is the time elapsed between the mixer and the end of the observation cell. Various experiments are presented for the determination of these parameters. The proposed calibration procedure is based on the evaluation of all experimental curves simultaneously, taking the concentration constraints into account. The simultaneous evaluation is possible because the recently developed stopped-flow spectrophotometers give accurate measured absorbances. Therefore, the use of the pseudo-first-order approach is not necessary; measurements carried out under second-order conditions may also be evaluated without any simplification. The formation kinetics of the well-known {FeSCN2+} complex has been reinvestigated in order to compare the results of the experiments carried out under pseudo-first-order and second-order conditions. The equilibrium and kinetic studies were carried out in an extended concentration and {pH} range. A slightly modified mechanism, involving the reaction between Fe2({OH)24+} and {SCN−}, and the appropriate rate constants are reported. The evaluation procedure developed can be extended to arbitrary reactions, and thus it increases the type of reactive chemical systems accessible for stopped-flow studies (e.g. accumulation of absorbing intermediates, autocatalytic reactions, etc.).},

	abstract = {The formation of the iron({III)-thiocyanate} complex in sulphuric and perchloric acids has been studied spectrophotometrically. Under no circumstances has any evidence been found that more than one thiocyanate ion enters the complex, contrary to widely held beliefs that up to six ions may be involved. Hydroxyl, sulphate and hydrogen sulphate ions and water molecules complete the co-ordination sphere. Decomposition products have been isolated and identified. Three ranges of acid concentration are identified, each region characterised by the manner of variation of the molar absorptivity and formation constant with change in acid concentration, and an interpretation is offered. Decomposition of both reagent and complex render thiocyanate unsatisfactory as a reagent for the precise determination of iron.},

Experimental Raman spectra of the iron({III)} isothiocyanate with higher coordination number in the acidic aqueous solution have been analyzed. Molecular modeling of the iron({III)} monoisothiocyanate complex was accomplished by the density functional theory ({DFT)} method using {B3LYP} and {PBE1PBE} functionals. Theoretical vibrational spectra of the iron({III)} monoisothiocyanate were interpreted by means of the potential energy distributions ({PEDs).} The influence of different solvation models and position of {SO42−} ligand vs. {NCS−} ligand upon its geometry and vibrational frequencies have been evaluated. The effect of {H2O/D2O} isotopic substitution on the experimental and calculated Raman spectra of iron({III)} isothiocyanates has been examined. Procedures of Raman spectra subtraction have been applied for the extractions of weak and/or obscured Raman signals. As a result, the presence of bound {SO42−} ion and water molecules in the first coordination sphere in the acidic aqueous iron({III)} isothiocyanate solution was confirmed. The vibrational assignments for the investigated iron({III)} isothiocyanates were proposed here for the first time.},

The measured relaxation rates are interpreted as a linear combination of the concentration of the different complexes. With this assumption, the following stepwide formation constants are given: log K1 = 2.53, log K2 = 1.35, log K3 = 1.31, log K4 = 1.33, log K5 = −0.32. The ratio of the stepwise equilibrium constants and the molar relaxation coefficients are interpreted by assuming octahedral-tetrahedral configuration equilibria in case of the bis, tris and tetrakis complexes.},
